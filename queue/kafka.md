### Use Apache Kafka if you want to:
* Ingest, store, and process event streams.
* Process millions of requests per second.
* Perform data analytics with native stream processing capabilities.
* Implement a pull-based consumption approach.
* Build event-driven, low-latency, trigger-based applications.
### Use RabbitMQ if you want to:
* Build a traditional pub-sub mechanism.
* Use different message routing techniques.
* Implement inter-process communication for microservices.
* Use messaging features that arenâ€™t present in Kafka, like ordering, priority, and requeuing.
* Use a particular messaging protocol.
* Access both push and pull-based consumption approaches.
