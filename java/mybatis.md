## Mybatis

* A Java persistence framework that aids in bridging the gap between object-oriented programming and SQL databases is MyBatis. It virtually eliminates all JDBC code and offers a simple, organized method for managing database operations. MyBatis emphasizes the developerâ€™s control over SQL queries more than Hibernate does.


### Mybatis vs Hibernate


* Control: 
  * Mybastis provides greater control than Hibernate over SQL queries, which can be an advantage if you need fine-grained optimization or need to work with complex queries

* Learning Curve:
  * Mybastis is relatively simpler than Hibernate. Hibernate has more abstraction and take a higher learning curver to master.

* ORM: 
  * Hibernate is a ORM framework, and handles all the object mapping automatically. MyBatis requires manual mapping of object fields to SQL query results, which can result in more coding.

* Cache:
  * Hibernate has better support on caching.

* Portability:
  * Hibernate has better portability on different database.
