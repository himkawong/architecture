## DB Partitioning

### Vertical partitioning

Moving some columns to new tables. Each table contains the same number of rows but fewer columns. 

### Horizontal partitioning
Dividing a table into multiple smaller tables. Each table is a separate data store, and it contains the same number of columns, but fewer rows.

### Horizontal Sharding
* Sharding is one specific type of partitioning. Sharding implies the data is spread across different computers while partitioing implies the data is spread within the same computer.
