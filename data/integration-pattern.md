# Integration Patterns

### Publish-Subscribe

* Used to broadcast events to subscribers

### Message Translator

* Acts as a mediator that translates data formats between sending and receiving systems, ensuring that data is understood correctly by the target system.

* Equivalent to the Adapter pattern

* Example Usage: Translate message in JSON into XML

### Message Router

* A design pattern that allows you to handle messages, specifically deciding where to send them based on specific criteria, without the need for the sender and receiver to be explicitly aware of each other. In essence, it determines the path a message should take based on its content, source, destination, or other criteria.

### Point-to-Point Channel

### Remote Procedure Invocation
