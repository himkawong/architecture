### [SOLID](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)
1. Single Responsibility (SRP) -  “A class (component) should have one, and only one, reason to change”
2. Open-Closed (OCP) - “A system should be open for extension, but closed for modification”
3. Liskov Substitution (LSP) - “Derived types should be substitutable for their base types”
4. Interface Segregation -  “Interfaces should be small, focused on a specific use case”
5. Dependency Inversion -  “Depend on abstractions, rather than concrete implementations”

### Four Rules of Simple Design
1. Tests Pass
2. Expresses Intent
3. No Duplication (DRY)
4. Small
